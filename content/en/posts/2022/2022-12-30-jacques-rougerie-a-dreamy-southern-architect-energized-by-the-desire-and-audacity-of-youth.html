        <p><i>"I see the desire, the audacity to find solutions. These young people want to act, they don't want to be told it's all over. They've been told too much. They're much more aware of today's major issues and dangers than our generation or even your generation. These young people are much more down to earth than we think, but above all they want to act, to find solutions and to believe in them.</i></p>
