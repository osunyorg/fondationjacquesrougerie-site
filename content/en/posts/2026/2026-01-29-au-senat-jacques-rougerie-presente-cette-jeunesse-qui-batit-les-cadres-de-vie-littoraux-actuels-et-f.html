    <p>  <br>On the occasion of the New Year’s ceremony of the Association des Conquérants Bretons (ACB), held in the prestigious setting of the French Senate at the Palais du Luxembourg, Jacques Rougerie spoke to present the action and vision of the Foundation. The evening took place in the presence of Hervé Berville, former Minister for the Sea and Member of Parliament for Côtes-d’Armor, and provided an opportunity to reaffirm a core conviction upheld by the Foundation: trusting young people, across all five continents, to imagine and build today’s and tomorrow’s coastal living environments in the face of climatic, social, and environmental transformations. The Foundation supports this international momentum through its network of Junior Ambassadors, active in many countries. These young talents help disseminate an approach based on the convergence of arts, sciences, and technologies, and contribute to the emergence of architectural, cultural, and scientific solutions adapted to the local realities of coastal territories. The Foundation extends its thanks to Vincent Lacroix Holley, President of the Association des Conquérants Bretons, for his invitation and for the quality of the discussions that marked this evening, held under the banner of dialogue, commitment, and transmission.</p>
