    <p>  <br>Jacques Rougerie was pleased to be welcomed by the Greek Minister of Environment and Energy, Stavros Papastavrou, on the occasion of a high-level exchange, notably attended by Petros Varelidis, Secretary General for Environment and Water. At the Minister’s request, this meeting provided an opportunity to present the work of the Fondation Jacques Rougerie – Académie des beaux-arts focused on the major coastal challenges arising from climate change, which particularly affect the Hellenic island worlds. Discussions addressed the tangible impact of shoreline changes on local populations, as well as how the Foundation, through its international architecture and innovation awards, could develop academic partnerships—particularly with the National Technical University of Athens—in order to involve students in designing solutions tailored to Greek coastal realities. In addition, the Minister took a close interest in the work carried out by the agency ROUGERIE+TANGRAM, especially regarding major themes of coastal planning, resilience, and bio-inspired architecture. The Foundation and Jacques Rougerie warmly thank Stavros Papastavrou, Petros Varelidis, Rodi Kratsa, Georgia Kouvela-Piquet, Michel Boudras, and Manolis Orphanoudakis for the quality of their welcome. These discussions open up concrete prospects for cooperation and the sharing of expertise. Greek youth, together with the Foundation’s Junior Ambassadors, are called upon to jointly imagine and build sustainable and desirable living environments.</p>
