    Eurojuris Annual Congress: When law engages in dialogue with architecture, through a multidisciplinary approach, to rethink contemporary living environments
  summary: >-
    <p>On January 29 and 30, the Eurojuris France network gathered in La Baule around a central question: “What if lawyers also pleaded for the planet?”</p><p>To open the 2026 edition, Jacques Rougerie delivered the keynote address, proposing a demanding dialogue between law, architecture, and environmental transitions, which immediately set the tone for the congress.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>First, Jacques Rougerie reflected on his vision as an architect, shaped by several decades of projects exploring the relationships between humanity, the ocean, and coastal territories. He emphasized how the major climate transformations currently underway—rising sea levels, shoreline evolution, and the increasing vulnerability of inhabited areas—directly challenge our ways of living and call for a local rethinking of living environments, integrating ecological dynamics and environmental realities. He then presented the work of the Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Académie des beaux-arts, highlighting the initiatives carried out by its Junior Ambassadors across all five continents. Combining foresight with concrete achievements, these young architects, engineers, and designers develop projects rooted in territorial realities, capable of delivering innovative responses to coastal and climate-related challenges. This segment powerfully illustrated the necessity of placing trust in the world’s youth to imagine and build today’s and tomorrow’s living environments. The remainder of the congress extended these reflections through several workshops devoted to corporate social responsibility (CSR), urban planning, construction, and the environment, underscoring the growing role of law as a lever to support ecological and territorial transitions. The Foundation warmly thanks Eurojuris France, all the speakers, and the participants for the quality of the discussions and the welcome extended to this 2026 edition, which successfully opened new avenues for interdisciplinary dialogue in the service of more sustainable and responsible living environments.</p>
