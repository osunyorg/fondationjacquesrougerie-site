    Entry into force of the BBNJ Treaty: a historic step forward for the protection of the high seas.
  summary: >-
    <p>  The entry into force of the BBNJ Treaty marks a historic milestone for the protection of the high seas and biodiversity, to which the Foundation actively contributes alongside international institutions, States, and stakeholders committed to sustainable ocean governance  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>For several years, the Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Académie des beaux-arts has been actively committed to the protection of the high seas and the preservation of marine biodiversity, driven by the conviction that the resilience of peoples can only be built in harmony with the living world, and that humanity shares a single Ocean—an essential global common good. This commitment was recently highlighted by the entry into force of the Treaty on the High Seas (BBNJ), a historic milestone for ocean governance made possible by the achievement of the required 60 State ratifications. On this occasion, the Foundation pays tribute to the decisive role played by Olivier Poivre d’Arvor, a key contributor to this major diplomatic success. This significant moment was also shared with Kamal Amakrane, United Nations Special Envoy for Climate, whose work within the Global Centre for Climate Mobility (GCCM) is making a concrete contribution to advancing the ocean–climate agenda at the international level. The Foundation is proud to be a partner of the GCCM, united by a shared commitment to supporting territories and communities most exposed to the impacts of climate change. The celebration of this decisive milestone took place in Nice, a city that has become a true standard-bearer for ocean-related issues, driven by the strong commitment of its Mayor, Christian Estrosi, and a municipal team deeply engaged on these matters, notably Olivier Bettati and Sébastien Scutca. The Foundation also wishes to commend the exemplary cooperation developed with H.E. Ana Elena Pinto Lizano, Ambassador of Costa Rica to France. Costa Rica, co-host country of the UNOC, has been a key partner in joint work focused on the city of Puntarenas, demonstrating that urban development, ecosystem protection, and the inclusion of local communities can be pursued in an integrated and complementary manner. The high seas represent nearly 50% of the Earth’s surface and more than 60% of the ocean. The international objective to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030 (30x30) is an essential condition for preserving marine biodiversity and strengthening the resilience of coastal territories. In light of these challenges, the Foundation reaffirms its conviction: the protection of the Ocean is a collective responsibility. It will continue its commitment alongside institutions, scientists, territories, and international youth to contribute to sustainable and inclusive governance of marine spaces.</p>
