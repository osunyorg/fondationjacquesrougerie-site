    Sharing, inspiring, engaging: the action of the Junior Ambassadors of the SEDNA project
  summary: >-
    <p>Winners of the Grand Prix Mer at the 2024 International Architecture and Innovation Competition, the SEDNA project continues to thrive well beyond the competition itself, driven by the commitment of our Junior Ambassadors, Marine Tacquet and Constance Fromentin. They fully embody the mission of the Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Académie des beaux-arts: to disseminate knowledge that helps shape today’s and tomorrow’s living environments.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>On December 5, on the occasion of Nautical Day, two members of the SEDNA team visited L’École de design Nantes Atlantique to meet middle and high school students. Through the presentation of their project, they shared their backgrounds, their vision of design, and their commitment to the Ocean, sparking meaningful exchanges with young people seeking purpose in their future career choices. During the afternoon, they also took part in a webinar for several classes, providing an opportunity to present their academic paths, explain the profession of designer, and broaden perspectives on careers linked to innovation in the maritime world within the context of the ecological transition. Representing the Foundation, our Junior Ambassadors convincingly emphasized that there are professional pathways that allow the combination of arts, science, and technology in service of Nature. The Foundation extends its warmest thanks to these two ambassadors for their exemplary commitment to knowledge sharing, as well as to L’École de design Nantes Atlantique—and in particular to Arnaud Le Roi and Christine Martin—for the invitation and the high quality of the discussions.</p>
