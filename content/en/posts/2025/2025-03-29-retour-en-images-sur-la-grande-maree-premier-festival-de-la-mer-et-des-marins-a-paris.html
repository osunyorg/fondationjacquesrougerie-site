    <p>  <br>On Saturday, March 29, Jacques Rougerie took the stage at La Grande Marée, an event organized by La Saison Bleue and the National Maritime Museum in Paris. <br>During this inspiring conference, he recounted his unique journey as both an architect and an oceanographer, and how he dedicated his life to revealing the beauty and richness of the Ocean - to the point of becoming the first of the "Mériens." 🌊 <br>The Fondation Jacques Rougerie - Académie des beaux-arts was also honored. Jacques Rougerie presented visionary projects led by passionate young people from around the globe. These young innovators, inspired by biomimetics, are devising innovative solutions to adapt our present and future living environments by combining arts, sciences, and technologies in the service of nature. 🌍 <br>A huge thank you 🙏 to the organizing teams for making La Grande Marée a standout event, a truly unmissable moment in the world of the Sea as the UN Ocean Conference (UNOC) approaches!  </p>
