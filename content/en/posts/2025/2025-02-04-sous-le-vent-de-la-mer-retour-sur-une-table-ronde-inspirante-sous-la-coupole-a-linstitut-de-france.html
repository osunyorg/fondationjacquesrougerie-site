    <p>  <br>Under the Sea Breeze ‚Äì A Recap of an Inspiring Roundtable Under the Dome at the Institut de France  ‚ú®üåä As part of the Year of the Sea, the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts and the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Architecture Paris-Malaquais organized the event "Under the Sea Breeze ‚Äì Futures of the Ocean and Coastal Architecture" in connection with climate change. This captivating discussion blended oceanic themes with architectural perspectives, bringing together architects, scientists, artists, and navigators. A huge thank you to Nicolas Gilsoul, who, like a maestro, wonderfully led the evening before an audience of architecture students from various schools, where the Jacques Rougerie Foundation - Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts was highlighted. Jacques Rougerie emphasized how, thanks to young talents from around the world, concrete solutions are emerging to build current and future living environments. He stressed the need to rekindle our vision of the oceans, to be bold, and to imagine new ways of inhabiting coastal areas. We extend our sincere thanks to Olivie Adam, Isabelle Aurissier, Marc Barani, Gilles Cleme, Eric Daniel-Lacombe, Fran√ßoise Gaill, Marine Miller, and Erik Orsenna who, through this roundtable, allowed the voice of the Ocean to resonate under the Dome. A huge thank you also goes to Zo√© Apitz Green, as well as to the teams from the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts and the Institut de France.</p>
