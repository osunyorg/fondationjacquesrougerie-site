    <p>  <br>The Foundation took part in the  3rd Climate Mobility Summit , held during the  80th United Nations General Assembly  in New York.  <br>This major international event, dedicated to  sea level rise  and the  risks of coastal displacement , brought together heads of state, experts, and institutions committed to building sustainable adaptation strategies for threatened territories. <br>During the session devoted to  island nations ,  Jacques Rougerie  shared his vision as both architect and humanist: to give communities facing rising waters  the opportunity to remain on their ancestral lands  rather than be forced into climate exile.  <br>His intervention was one of the highlights of the summit, opening new avenues for collaboration with island states. <br>This visit also led to key meetings with: <br>  <br>  <br> Carlos Alvarado Quesada , former President of Costa Rica <br>  <br>  <br> Feleti Teo , Prime Minister of Tuvalu <br>  <br>  <br> Terrence Drew , Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis <br>  <br>  <br> Mosese Bulitavu , Minister for the Environment of Fiji <br>  <br>  <br> Gustav Aitaro , Minister of State of Palau <br>  <br>  <br> Peter Thomson , United Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the Ocean <br>  <br>  <br>Together with the  Global Centre for Climate Mobility (GCCM)  and  UNOPS , under the leadership of  Professor Kamal Amakrane , and with the support of  Andrea Milan  and  Miguel Verzbolovskis , the Foundation is developing large-scale projects to  strengthen the resilience of Tuvalu , in partnership with the Minister of Home Affairs and Climate,  Mania Talia . <br>Through its  international reach  and its network of  Junior Ambassadors across five continents , the Foundation asserts itself as a key partner for coastal nations in their adaptation strategies.  <br>It works in synergy with  French diplomacy , represented by  Olivier Poivre d'Arvor ,  Ashok Adicéam ,  Benoît Faraco , and the  City of Nice , represented by  Olivier Bettati . <br>Finally,  Amine Lehna , Director of Development and International Relations, also spoke on behalf of the  Junior Ambassadors , this new generation committed to defending the future of coastal communities. <br>Sea level rise is not inevitable. Together, we must design  sustainable and desirable solutions  that restore hope for generations to come.  </p>
