    Jacques Rougerie at the Château du Clos Lucé

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>📍 Amboise - June 7 to September 10, 2025 <br> The  Château du Clos Lucé , Leonardo da Vinci's final residence, continues its exploration of the master's scientific and visionary research with a new exhibition dedicated to  biomimicry . This approach seeks to observe and understand the forms, materials, and processes of living organisms in order to design innovative and sustainable solutions. <br> The exhibition invites visitors to rethink their relationship with nature: not as a resource to be exploited, but as a sustainable reservoir of inspiration to be respected and preserved. <br> On this occasion, visitors will discover the  biomimetic work of Jacques Rougerie , architect, oceanographer, and member of the Académie des beaux-arts, who has devoted more than fifty years to imagining sustainable habitats in symbiosis with the oceans and space. Models, projects, and prospective visions will offer a unique insight into an architecture that is both poetic and visionary, directly inspired by the genius of the living world. <br> This exhibition highlights the dialogue between two creative figures, separated by centuries yet united by a common ambition:  drawing from nature the keys to a sustainable and harmonious future . <br>* More information and tickets:  Château du Clos Lucé</p>
