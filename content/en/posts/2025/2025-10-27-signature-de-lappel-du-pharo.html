    Signing of the Pharo Appeal

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>At the close of Biomim’EXPO, Jacques Rougerie signed the Pharo Appeal, a collective statement initiated by Alain Renaudin, alongside researchers, entrepreneurs, and advocates committed to the living world. This appeal calls on us to “rebuild society with the Living,” recognizing nature not as a resource to be exploited, but as our best model and most powerful partner. Working hand in hand with nature means drawing inspiration from its 3.8 billion years of evolution to build the future.</p>
