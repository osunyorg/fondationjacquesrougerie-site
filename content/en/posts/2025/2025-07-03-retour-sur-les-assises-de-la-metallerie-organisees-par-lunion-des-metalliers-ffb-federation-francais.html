    <p>  <br>Jacques Rougerie had the honor of delivering the closing address at the Assises de la Métallerie, organized by the Union of Metalworkers – FFB (French Building Federation). 💡 On this day dedicated to sharing and innovation, Jacques Rougerie paid a heartfelt and admiring tribute to the young winners of the Métal’Jeunes Competition, who envisioned the habitats of the future inspired by the four elements. These visionary projects, driven by a creative and committed generation, deeply reflect the values of transmission and forward-thinking that are central to the Foundation. 💬 In a speech highlighting his own projects, Jacques Rougerie shared his vision of a biomimetic and purpose-driven architecture, inspired by the sea and living organisms. It was an invitation to dream, to marvel, and to rethink our relationship with the world by building sustainable and resilient living environments. 🌍 “It is not nature that is in danger—it is humanity.” With these words, Jacques Rougerie proposed an alternative path: one of imagination and boldness, to shape a future in harmony with our planet, by blending art, science, and technology. 🌊 🙏 The Foundation warmly thanks the Union of Metalworkers and the FFB – French Building Federation for this wonderful invitation.</p>
