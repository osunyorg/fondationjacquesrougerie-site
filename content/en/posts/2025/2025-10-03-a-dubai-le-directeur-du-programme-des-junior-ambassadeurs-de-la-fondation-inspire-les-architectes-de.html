    <p>  <br>On  September 25 ,  Mohamed Emad , Director of the Junior Ambassadors Program, gave an inspiring lecture at  Heriot-Watt University Dubai Campus . <br>Addressing a full class of architecture students, he explored the synergies between  biomimicry  and  artificial intelligence  in architectural design, demonstrating how forms inspired by the  ocean  and  space  can open new pathways for  coastal resilience  and  urban development . <br> The session was followed by an interactive workshop where students experimented with how natural systems- coral reefs, marine ecosystems, spatial morphologies -can inspire new architectural solutions to address the challenges of housing, urban density, and sustainability. <br> This event is part of the ongoing partnership between the Foundation and  Heriot-Watt University Dubai , whose annual studio focuses on the theme  "Water-Friendly Communities."  <br>This collaboration reflects the Foundation's commitment to connecting  research, youth, and innovation , uniting  art, science, and technology  in harmony with  nature .</p>
