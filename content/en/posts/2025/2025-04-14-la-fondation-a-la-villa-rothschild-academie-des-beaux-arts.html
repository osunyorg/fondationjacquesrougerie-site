    <p>  <br>The Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Académie des Beaux-Arts at the Villa Rothschild. A huge thank you to Muriel Mayette-Holtz, Director of the Villa Rothschild, and to the entire Villa team for organizing this wonderful, warmly engaging evening during which guests immersed themselves in the oceanic and space explorations recounted by Jacques Rougerie. On Thursday, April 3, he led a dinner-conference as part of the “Jeudis de la Villa,” held at the Villa Rothschild—property of the Académie des Beaux-Arts—in the breathtaking setting of the Bay of Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat. Through this inspiring conference-debate, he reflected on his unique journey as both architect and oceanographer, and on how he has devoted his life to researching and realizing marine and space architecture. The Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Académie des Beaux-Arts was also honored: Jacques Rougerie presented visionary projects led by engaged young people across five continents. These young architects, drawing inspiration from biomimicry, design innovative solutions to adapt our present and future living environments, combining art, science, and technology in the service of nature.</p>
