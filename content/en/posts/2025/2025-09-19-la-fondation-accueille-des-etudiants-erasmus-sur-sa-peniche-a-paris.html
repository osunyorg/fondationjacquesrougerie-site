    The Foundation is hosting Erasmus students on Jacques Rougerie's barge in Paris

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>This Friday, September 19, the Jacques Rougerie Foundation - Académie des beaux-arts had the pleasure of welcoming to Paris a group of Erasmus students engaged in a study program dedicated to learning real estate professions. <br> Jacques Rougerie spoke to them about the major transformations currently reshaping our living environments due to climate change and the evolution of our societies. Through architecture and engineering, he presented some of his great visionary achievements, from  Galathée  to  SeaOrbiter , including his futuristic habitats on land, at sea, and in space. He also shared his experience of living underwater, where our senses are disrupted, but where human adaptability allows, after a few hours, to enter into harmony with the marine world. Beyond architecture, he above all conveyed an essential message to this youth coming from all over Europe:  <br>👉 in an uncertain world, one must know how to dream. Dreams are a strength, a compass, and a driving force for building the living environments of today and tomorrow. In this spirit, for more than 15 years, the Foundation has been encouraging young talents in architecture and engineering from five continents to invent sustainable and desirable solutions by combining arts, sciences, technologies, and nature.  At the end of this meeting, several students expressed strong motivation to join the Foundation's Junior Ambassadors program, in order to carry forward this dynamic and embody these values internationally. <br> We warmly thank these students and their professors for their curiosity and enthusiasm. May their dreams help shape a desirable future for all.  </p>
