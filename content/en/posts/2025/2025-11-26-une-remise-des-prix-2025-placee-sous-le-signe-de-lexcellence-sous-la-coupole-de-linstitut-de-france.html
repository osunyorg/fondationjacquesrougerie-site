    A 2025 Awards Ceremony Marked by Excellence Under the Dome of the Institut de France
  summary: >-
    <p>On 26 November 2025, beneath the magnificent Dome of the Palais de l’Institut de France, the Foundation celebrated the International Architecture and Innovation Grand Prizes 2025, Antoine Grolin Promotion.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Held under the High Patronage of H.S.H. Prince Albert II of Monaco, Honorary President of the Foundation, the ceremony brought together leading institutional, scientific, artistic, and climate-focused figures, including Catherine Chabaud, Minister for the Sea and Fisheries, Kamal Amakrane, United Nations Special Envoy for Climate, and Coline Serreau, President of the Institut de France and of the Académie des beaux-arts. The event gathered sixty young architects, engineers, designers, and researchers from all five continents. Each presented work demonstrating remarkable creativity at the crossroads of technological innovation, life sciences, arts, and the major climate, coastal, oceanic, and space-related challenges of our century. This committed generation—connected to the realities of the field as well as to far-reaching prospective visions—embodies the mission of the Foundation: imagining sustainable and desirable living environments rooted in the union of arts, sciences, technologies, and nature. The ceremony also highlighted the pivotal role of the Foundation’s international network of Junior Ambassadors, now active in more than one hundred countries. These young creators form a global community working collectively to design and disseminate new solutions within a true planetary laboratory of innovation. At a time when the Foundation is strengthening its global engagement, particularly through its participation in major climate and ocean conferences worldwide, this dynamic reflects the scope and diversity of the talents united around its mission. The 2025 edition distinguished several outstanding projects.  TideFusion, led by Katrin Tomas (Costa Rica), proposes a permeable, regenerative architecture that reconnects coastal communities with the mangrove ecosystem, transforming an arid boundary into a living interface filtering water, generating energy, and supporting biodiversity.  In the Sea category, Abyssora, created by Nawrass Kamour and Josua Hefti (Morocco–Libya / Switzerland–Austria), reinvents ship dismantling by giving vessels a second life as floating archipelagos where human habitats coexist with marine ecosystems.  In the Space category, TRINITY, designed by Thomas Herzig and Daniil Zhiltsov (Austria, Russia), envisions a space station assembled on the asteroid Itokawa, equipped with inflatable modules, artificial gravity, and systems capable of producing oxygen and food—foreshadowing a new era of interplanetary architecture. The Special Lab Prize honored Pineflux by Samer El Sayari (Egypt), which imagines a biomimetic Martian structure combining a flexible endoskeleton and a protective exoskeleton inspired by pinecone scales. Two special mentions were awarded: Karea, a French–Korean project that transforms invasive sargassum in Guadeloupe into bio-based materials and renewable energy; and Flots Ternes from Côte d’Ivoire, a poetic proposal envisioning floating dwellings that protect the people of Grand-Lahou while harmonizing with tidal rhythms. The Artistic Prizes for the Sea and Space, awarded in collaboration with the Académie des beaux-arts, also received special recognition. This year, they went to French composer Camille Pépin and French painter Yann Bagot, whose works explore the intimate relationship between humanity, water, and the cosmos. Through this ceremony, the Foundation reaffirmed its commitment to supporting a new generation of visionary creators, capable of proposing bold, biomimetic, and deeply humanistic responses to global transformations. In partnership with UNESCO, the United Nations, and numerous international institutions, the Foundation will present these projects on major climate and ocean stages in 2026, multiplying opportunities, collaborations, and connections between emerging creators and decision-makers worldwide. More than ever, the 2025 edition reflects a shared conviction: the future will be built at the intersection of arts, sciences, technologies, and the living world—and it is to this convergence that the Foundation dedicates its daily mission.</p>
