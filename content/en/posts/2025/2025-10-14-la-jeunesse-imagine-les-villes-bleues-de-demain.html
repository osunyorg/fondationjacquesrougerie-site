    Youth Imagines the Blue Cities of Tomorrow at Brussels

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The Foundation is proud to have been a partner of the “Designing Blue Cities” Lab, organized by the European Union as part of the European Week of Regions and Cities (EURegionsWeek) in Brussels. This innovation laboratory, initiated by the EU4Ocean Coalition, brought together young professionals and students from across Europe to rethink how coastal cities can adapt to the challenges of climate change. The Foundation’s European Junior Ambassadors stood out for the depth of their analyses and the creativity of their proposals. Using “Venice 2100” as a case study, they explored several adaptation scenarios for the city in response to rising sea levels: amphibious housing, blue mobility, reversible architecture, bio-based materials, and integrated ecosystems—all innovative ideas emerging from their creativity and commitment. Through their reflections, participants reminded us that architecture is not just a discipline but a language of hope. Empowering young people to dream, design, and build sustainable living environments is a concrete way to address the climatic and social challenges of the 21st century. The Foundation warmly thanks Pierre Strosser, Anna Maria Marino, and the Youth4Ocean network for organizing this first edition, as well as all the speakers for the quality and inspiration of their contributions: Hadi El Hage, Alankrita Sarkar, Paul Trautendorfer, Victor Brunfaut, Laurens Maertens, Tania Feldzer, Amine Lehna, Letizia Artioli, and Folco Soffietti. Together, let us continue to imagine and build the blue cities of tomorrow, where the ocean, science, and art come together in service of a sustainable future.</p>
