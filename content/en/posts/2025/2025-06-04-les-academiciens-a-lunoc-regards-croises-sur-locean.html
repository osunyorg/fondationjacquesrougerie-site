    <p>  <br>🌊 The Academicians at the UNOC: Crossed Perspectives on the Ocean On June 4, 2025, during the United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC), a truly exceptional moment took place at La Baleine: for the first time, four members of the Académie des beaux-arts came together for a public dialogue dedicated to the Ocean. At the invitation of the Fondation Jacques Rougerie – Académie des beaux-arts, this gathering offered a rare voice in major international forums: the voice of art, creation, and sensitivity. 🎭 Muriel Mayette-Holtz, actress and stage director 🎼 Régis Campo, composer 🏛 Marc Barani, architect 🌊 Jacques Rougerie, architect and oceanographer All four shared their vision of the Ocean through the lens of their disciplines, in a conversation that was both profound and poetic—rooted in the beauty of the world and in the lucid awareness of the threats weighing upon it. The horizon served as the backbone of the exchange: a vanishing line, a line of hope, a line of tension as well—between the visible and the invisible, between what still connects us to the Ocean and what risks pulling us away from it. 🙏 Deepest thanks to the Académie des beaux-arts, its Perpetual Secretary Laurent Petitgirard, the Institut de France, and its Chancellor Xavier Darcos, for allowing this artistic voice to resonate within one of the most symbolic arenas of global multilateralism. 📍Join us on June 5 for L’Université de l’Océan, where other voices—young, scientific, creative—will carry forward the song of our blue planet.</p>
