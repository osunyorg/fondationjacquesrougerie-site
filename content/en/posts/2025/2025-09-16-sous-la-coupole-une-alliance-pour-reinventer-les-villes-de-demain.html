    Sous la Coupole, une alliance pour réinventer les villes de demain

    <p>  <br>On Tuesday, September 16, under the Dome of the Institut de France, the Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Academy of Fine Arts marked a decisive milestone by formalizing a major partnership with Nhood / Ceetrus and Groupe Projex, in the presence of their president, Antoine Grolin. The ceremony was chaired by Laurent Petitgirard, Perpetual Secretary of the Academy of Fine Arts, alongside Jacques Rougerie, founder of the Foundation. Committed to the sustainable transformation of territories, Nhood / Ceetrus and Groupe Projex share with the Jacques Rougerie Foundation a common vision: to imagine and build the living spaces of tomorrow based on the concept of the 15-minute city. This theme was at the heart of the event, attended by its originator, Carlos Moreno, President of the Foundation’s Scientific Council. This strategic alliance reflects a shared ambition: to sustainably re-enchant our living environments, whether urban, terrestrial, or coastal, in the face of today’s major challenges. Together, we embrace a cross-disciplinary, cultural, and global approach supported by an active network across five continents. At a time when humanity’s pressing challenges demand new models, this partnership offers a strong and concrete response. Nhood / Ceetrus, Groupe Projex, and the Jacques Rougerie Foundation will work together on a range of programs to rethink and build more resilient spaces, adapted to the realities of climate change—particularly rising sea levels—and to promote a new way of inhabiting the world. In this context, we are delighted to announce that Antoine Grolin will serve as the Patron of the 2025 class of the International Architecture and Innovation Competition of the Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Academy of Fine Arts. Stay tuned to follow this exciting journey, which fully embodies the shared values and passions of our two worlds.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> </p>
