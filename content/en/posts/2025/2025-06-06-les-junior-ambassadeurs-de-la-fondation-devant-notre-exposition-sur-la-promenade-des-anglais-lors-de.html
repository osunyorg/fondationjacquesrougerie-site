    <p>  <br>As part of the United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice, the Junior Ambassadors of the Fondation Jacques Rougerie – Académie des beaux-arts had the pleasure of discovering their own projects exhibited on the iconic Promenade des Anglais, right in front of the Mediterranean University Center. This open-air exhibition, designed as a journey of discovery, showcases the innovative solutions imagined over the past fifteen years by the winners and finalists of the Foundation’s International Architecture and Innovation Competition. 🖼️ The projects on display tackle major challenges: rising sea levels, shifting coastlines, and the adaptation of coastal territories. They embody the Foundation’s core vision: combining art, science, technology, and nature to shape the living spaces of today and tomorrow. 🚀 👥 During the exhibition, visitors had the opportunity to engage directly with our Junior Ambassadors—who came from across five continents—and to explore concrete, responsible, and visionary approaches. These young talents helped raise public awareness of key issues related to coastal transformation, sea level rise, and the new solutions needed to address climate disruption. Through their projects, they shared their deep conviction that it is urgent to reinvent architecture and rethink, in a more sustainable way, how we build, live, and coexist with marine ecosystems. 🙏 Special thanks to the Fondation Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, the City of Nice, and all our partners for making this exhibition possible in such an iconic location.</p>
