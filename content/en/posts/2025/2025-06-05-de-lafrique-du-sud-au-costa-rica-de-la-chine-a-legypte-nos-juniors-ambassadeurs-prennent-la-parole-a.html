    <p>  <br>At the United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC 2025) in Nice, a powerful moment was led by youth: the Junior Ambassadors of the Fondation Jacques Rougerie ‚Äì Acad√©mie des beaux-arts. Hailing from five continents, these young architects, urban planners, engineers, and designers came to present the projects they submitted as part of the Foundation‚Äôs International Architecture and Innovation Competition. Visionary projects to reinvent coastal and marine living environments in the face of rising sea levels and erosion caused by climate change. ‚ú® Through this unique keynote, they voiced a shared conviction: youth holds solutions and is ready to take action. Before the United Nations, they reminded the world that the future cannot be built without their voice, their creativity, and their boldness. üôè A heartfelt thank you to all our Junior Ambassadors for their presence and unwavering commitment. They are living proof that a different future is possible ‚Äî a more sustainable one, uniting art, science, and technology in harmony with Nature.  </p>
