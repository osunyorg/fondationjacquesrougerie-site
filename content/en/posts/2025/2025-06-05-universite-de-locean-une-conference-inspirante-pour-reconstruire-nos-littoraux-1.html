    <p>  <br>As part of the United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC 2025) in Nice, the Fondation Jacques Rougerie – Académie des beaux-arts launched its series of conferences with an opening roundtable focused on transition, innovation, and commitment. 🌍 Carlos Moreno emphasized the urgent need to adapt our living environments, advocating for cities where people can live, work, and move more locally — all in service of a sustainable, human-centered, and daily-grounded transition. 🗺 Damienne Provitolo highlighted how essential a multidisciplinary approach is to analyze territorial dynamics, particularly in coastal areas facing complex environmental crises. 🌍 Jean-Christophe Ndongo reminded the audience that Africa is fully part of this global momentum, with an engaged youth already offering bold, locally rooted solutions. 🎓 Maurille LARIVIERE, director of Besign School, presented an exemplary student project: a floating rescue system designed to save lives during floods — a creative and urgent response to climate risks. 🧭 Jacques ROUGERIE opened the conference by presenting the Foundation’s mission: for the past fifteen years, it has been promoting visionary and sustainable solutions to rethink how we inhabit coastal areas and the Ocean, by blending art, science, and technology with Nature. 🗣 The discussion was moderated by Arnaud Réaux, an architect and urban resilience expert, who skillfully facilitated dialogue between these diverse perspectives. ✨ Follow the Foundation’s journey at UNOC!</p>
