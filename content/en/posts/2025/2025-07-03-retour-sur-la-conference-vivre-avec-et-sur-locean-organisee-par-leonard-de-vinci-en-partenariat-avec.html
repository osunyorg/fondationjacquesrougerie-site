    <p>  <br>🌊 On July 3rd, Jacques Rougerie had the pleasure and honor of speaking at the conference “Living With and On the Ocean,” organized by Leonard – foresight and innovation by VINCI, in partnership with the NGO Civilisation Indigo. 🏝 At a time when island territories are on the front lines of rising sea levels, the event shed light on adaptive models such as the Smart Offshore Ecosystem, developed in Bora Bora by Civilisation Indigo. An inspiring project that Jacques Rougerie praised while presenting several initiatives from the Foundation’s International Architecture and Innovation Competition, led by laureates from around the world. These young talents, brought together through the Foundation’s Junior Ambassadors Program, are designing bioinspired infrastructures that reconcile human use with the protection of marine ecosystems. 🌐 Jacques Rougerie was delighted to share these reflections alongside Frédéric Pons, President of Civilisation Indigo, and Denis Lacroix, Foresight Delegate at Ifremer, whose research and initiatives for the Ocean and coastal regions enrich the Foundation’s ongoing vision—one that imagines present and future living environments through the fusion of art, science, and technology in service of Nature. 🙏 Sincere thanks to Leonard de VINCI, Civilisation Indigo, and all the speakers for the depth and richness of the discussions.</p>
