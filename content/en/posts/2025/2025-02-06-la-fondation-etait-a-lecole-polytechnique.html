    <p>Jacques Rougerie inspired École Polytechnique students to envision and build future living environments during an engaging conference-debate.</p>

    <p>  <br>Recap of Jacques Rougerie's Conference-Debate at École Polytechnique Jacques Rougerie had the pleasure of delivering a conference-debate at École Polytechnique on the theme "Build Your Future, Realize Your Dreams," organized by Professor Brice Piechaczyk, whom we warmly thank. In front of a student audience, he shared his forward-thinking work and highlighted the projects of the Junior Ambassadors of the Jacques Rougerie Foundation, who, across five continents, envision both current and future living environments. We are delighted to announce that the students of École Polytechnique will be participating in the Jacques Rougerie Foundation’s International Architecture and Innovation Contest - Académie des beaux-arts. This new collaboration acknowledges the scientific and technological excellence of the school, which plays an essential role in addressing the challenges of tomorrow. And this is just the beginning! Next year, it is planned that Jacques Rougerie, along with the Foundation, will be invited by École Polytechnique to organize another conference-debate, reaffirming their shared commitment to education: empowering youth to become the bold builders of future living environments.</p>
