    <p>  <br>The  Fondation Jacques Rougerie - Académie des beaux-arts  is delighted to announce the appointment of Mr.  Mohamed EMAD  as Director of the Junior Ambassadors Program for the Foundation for the year 2025. With his experience in the arabic Gulf region, he will invigorate our efforts in the Middle East, a region also facing challenges related to coastal issues and rising sea levels. 🌊 In his new role, he will be supported by Mr.  Jose Carlo Bolaños Padilla , appointed as Vice-Director. Based in Latin America, he will help strengthen the Foundation’s impact in universities across the region, notably in Costa Rica and soon in Guatemala. Together, they will be tasked with supporting and inspiring our global network of Junior Ambassadors, addressing global challenges in key areas such as the ocean, space, and coastal regions affected by rising sea levels. 🚀🌐 We would also like to extend our warm thanks to  CEDRIX TSAMBANG . Thanks to his leadership in 2024, the program experienced a significant revitalization and established strategic partnerships in Africa. As a former director, he now joins the ethics committee and heads the African strategy for the Junior Ambassadors. 🤝 The  Fondation Jacques Rougerie - Académie des beaux-arts  is excited to present the projects of this new team! ✨</p>
