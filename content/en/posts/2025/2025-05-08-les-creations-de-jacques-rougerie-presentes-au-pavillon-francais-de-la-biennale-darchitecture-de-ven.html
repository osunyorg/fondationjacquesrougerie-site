    Jacques Rougerie’s creations at the French Pavilion of the 2025 Venice Architecture Biennale

    <p>At the French Pavilion of the 2025 Venice Biennale, the "Bio-inspiration and Eco-mimetics" project restores Intechmer and Collignon Beach using innovative concretes made from scallop shells and port sediments.</p>

    <p>  <br>FRENCH PAVILION AT THE 2025 VENICE ARCHITECTURE BIENNALE  <br>We are delighted and proud to share these images with Jacques Rougerie, taken in the heart of the French Pavilion at the 2025 Venice Architecture Biennale, where the "Bio-inspiration and Eco-mimetics" renaturation project for Intechmer-led by TITAN (lead architect)-is on display. <br> This renaturation is exemplified by the use of innovative structural concretes made from locally sourced scallop shells and port dredging sediments-recycled in a short supply chain-to replace sand and gravel. <br> It incorporates the existing Intechmer building designed by the ROUGERIE + TANGRAM agency for the Cotentin Agglomeration Community, as well as the restoration of Collignon Beach in the city of Cherbourg-en-Cotentin (led by SEMPER­VIRENS LANDSCAPERS). <br> This project addresses coastal challenges that the Jacques Rougerie Foundation tackles through its international Architecture and Innovation competitions. <br> We warmly thank Jakob + MacFarlane (Dominique Jakob & Brendan MacFarlane), Éric Daniel-Lacombe, and Martin Duplantier 🇺🇦🇪🇺 for their work on the French Pavilion.</p>
