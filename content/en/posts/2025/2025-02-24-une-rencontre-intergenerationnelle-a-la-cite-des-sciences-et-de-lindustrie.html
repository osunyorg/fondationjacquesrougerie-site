    <p>  <br>As part of the Year of the Sea – La Mer en Commun, the Foundation showcased its work over several days at the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie.An Encounter with the Young OnesOn February 14 and 20, the Foundation had the immense pleasure of introducing children from CP to CM2 to the wonders of the marine world. Our activities enabled these young explorers to learn more about the ocean, its biodiversity, and to raise their awareness of the environmental challenges it faces. Moreover, by learning about the concept of biomimicry, they discovered how drawing inspiration from nature allows humans to push the limits of innovation. A big thank you to the children, teachers, and everyone who participated in this maritime adventure!A Booth for the CuriousOn February 15, the Foundation's team had the pleasure of engaging with families present, introducing the youngest to biomimicry—a method that draws architectural solutions from nature to tackle environmental challenges. We also showcased the Foundation's projects, supported by our international network of Junior Ambassadors in over 100 countries. These young creators, architects, and passionate designers are working on solutions to global challenges, such as new coastal living environments in the face of climate change, rising sea levels, and both oceanic and space explorations.</p>
