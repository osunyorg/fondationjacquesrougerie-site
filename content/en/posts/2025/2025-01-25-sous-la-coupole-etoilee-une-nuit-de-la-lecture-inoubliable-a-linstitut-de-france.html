        <p>✨ Looking Back on the Night of Reading at the Institut de France 📚🌌</p><p>On Saturday, January 25, 2025, the Institut de France hosted the Night of Reading under its starry dome, themed “Heritage in Pages.” This evening dedicated to literary treasures allowed academicians and students to share texts that have deeply moved them. </p><p>Jacques Rougerie opened the doors to his universe by reading the stories that have shaped his journey: Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne. The reading concluded with a suspended moment as the song of whales resonated under the dome, enveloping the guests in a sensory symphony.</p>
