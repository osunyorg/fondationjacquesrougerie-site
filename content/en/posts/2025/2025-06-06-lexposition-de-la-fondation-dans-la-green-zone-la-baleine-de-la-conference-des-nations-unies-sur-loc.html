    <p>  <br>At the heart of the Green Zone of the United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice, inside the Palais des CongrÃ¨s â€“ La Baleine, the Fondation Jacques Rougerie â€“ AcadÃ©mie des beaux-arts is presenting an exceptional exhibition dedicated to the winning and nominated projects from its International Architecture and Innovation Competition. Located in one of the busiest areas, the exhibition draws a daily international audience eager to discover bold new visions from young architects, engineers, urban planners, and committed designers. Whether low-tech or high-tech, the featured projects capture visitors' attention through powerful bioinspired concepts that combine art, science, and technology in service of Nature and the Ocean. Through this unique exhibition, visitors are introduced to concrete solutions to major challenges such as climate change, rising sea levels, and coastal adaptation. These projectsâ€”selected from across five continents and addressing diverse environmental contextsâ€”demonstrate the creativity and commitment of a new generation ready to take action.</p>
