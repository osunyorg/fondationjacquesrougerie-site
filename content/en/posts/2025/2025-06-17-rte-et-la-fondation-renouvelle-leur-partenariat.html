    <p>  <br>On June 17, 2025, under the Dome of the Institut de France, RTE, represented by Chairman of the Executive Board Xavier Piechaczyk, his advisor Jennifer Lormier, and Marine Yver, Head of Maritime Public Affairs, signed a partnership agreement with the Jacques Rougerie Foundation. The signing took place in the presence of Laurent Petitgirard, Permanent Secretary of the Académie des Beaux-Arts and President of the Foundation, as well as Jacques Rougerie, Founder of the Foundation. RTE is a valuable and long-standing partner of the Foundation. As a member of our international jury, the company contributes essential expertise in the energy sector. This collaboration helps to highlight architectural and innovative projects that fully integrate challenges related to the production, transmission, and optimization of renewable energy sources. In 2024, the Chairman of RTE’s Executive Board awarded the Foundation’s Special Lab Prize to the L.I.S.A. project—an autonomous research center built from repurposed offshore stations and powered by marine renewable energy. This award perfectly embodies what unites us: active support for applied research and R&D innovation, with a shared ambition to design resilient and sustainable living environments. Beyond awarding prizes, the Foundation serves as an incubator—a true laboratory of the future. Thanks to the involvement of partners like RTE, we support laureates in the tangible development of their projects. Together, we strive to bring forth both current and forward-thinking solutions, designed for the medium and long term, and rooted in local, climatic, and energy realities. During the United Nations Ocean Conference held in Nice in June 2025, RTE also partnered with the exhibition on the Promenade des Anglais and participated in the conference-debate titled “How Can We Adapt to Major Climate Challenges?”. Regis Boigegrain, Executive Director of Interconnections and Offshore Network Engineering, spoke alongside other industrial leaders to emphasize RTE’s commitment to major environmental issues, particularly those affecting coastal living environments.</p>
