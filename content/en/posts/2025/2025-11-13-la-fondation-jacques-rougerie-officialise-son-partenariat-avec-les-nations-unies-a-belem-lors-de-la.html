    The Foundation Formalizes Its Partnership with the United Nations in Belém at COP30
  summary: >-
    <p>On 10 November, within the Climate Mobility Pavilion at COP30 in Belém, a strategic partnership was signed between the Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Académie des beaux-arts and the Global Centre for Climate Mobility (GCCM).</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The agreement, concluded by Jacques Rougerie and Kamal Amakrane, United Nations Special Envoy for Climate and Director-General of the GCCM, marks a major milestone for a unique project: the creation of a Museum for the Tuvalu people. This future space will be devoted to the memory, identity, and resilience of a nation directly threatened by rising sea levels. Addressing the international community gathered in Belém, Jacques Rougerie emphasized the importance of bringing together art, science, and technology in connection with nature to imagine bio-inspired architectural responses to the great challenges of our century. He noted that “this museum must be biomimetic, vernacular, and timeless — a symbol for island nations facing the climate emergency.” The signing took place in the presence of Maina Vakafua Talia, Minister of Home Affairs and Environment of Tuvalu, who stated: “This partnership represents an important step in our efforts to safeguard the culture and identity of Tuvalu. We want a museum that tells our story to the world, with and for our people.” This collaboration fully embodies the Foundation’s mission: placing creation, science, and nature at the heart of solutions to build a sustainable and inclusive future.</p>
