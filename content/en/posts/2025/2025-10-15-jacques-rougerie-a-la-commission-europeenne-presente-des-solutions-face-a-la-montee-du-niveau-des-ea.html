    <p>  <br>As part of the European program EU4Ocean – MakeEUBlue: Cities in Action, the Foundation took part in a series of discussions in Brussels focused on how European cities can strengthen their resilience to rising sea levels. During the “From Inspiration to Implementation” session, the Foundation presented its work to a panel of European policymakers, emphasizing how architecture and science must now work in harmony with the ocean to design the cities of tomorrow. The discussion featured Christophe Clergeau, Member of the European Parliament committed to regional transitions, and Sébastien Scutca, Special Adviser to the Mayor of Nice, highlighting concrete solutions for coastal and urban adaptation. The Foundation’s European Junior Ambassadors also contributed to this dynamic through their participation in the Designing Blue Cities Innovation Lab, a forward-looking workshop envisioning Venice in 2100 in the face of rising sea levels. Their proposals underscored the vital role of youth in building a resilient and sustainable future. The Foundation warmly thanks Pierre Strosser and the entire EU4Ocean – ACTeon Environment team for organizing this event, which successfully brought together institutions, researchers, policymakers, and young talents around a shared goal: building a future in harmony with the sea.</p>
