  body: >-
    <p>  <br>On April 24 in Cagnes-sur-Mer, the Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Académie des Beaux-Arts was present, with Jacques Rougerie as jury president, for the final defenses of the Master’s program “Design in Sustainable Innovation” at Besign School. The day was rich in exchanges, diverse perspectives, and discoveries. The students presented rigorous projects at the intersection of research, creation, and societal challenges. Each proposal embodied a profound commitment: imagining a more respectful, more restrained, more vibrant world. We applaud the quality of the work achieved, as well as the support provided by the Besign School’s teaching team. Witnessing a new generation of designers who are clear-sighted and driven by ecological urgency is a source of hope and energy for our Foundation. Thank you to the school for the invitation, and congratulations to all those who defended their work with courage and passion.</p>
