    Birth of the Scientific Council of the Fondation Jacques Rougerie – A First Meeting at the Institut de France
  summary: >-
    <p>On November 26, 2025, ahead of the International Awards Ceremony for Architecture and Innovation, the Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Académie des beaux-arts convened its International Scientific Committee for the first time at the Institut de France. A founding moment for the Foundation’s 2030–2050 trajectory.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Conceived as a scientific body for reflection, analysis, and perspective-setting, the Scientific Council serves as a forum for the convergence of knowledge and disciplines around the fundamental issues championed by the Foundation. Placed under the chairmanship of Professor Carlos Moreno, a globally recognized scientist for his work on sustainable cities and territorial resilience, it brings together academic figures and experts from complementary fields. Through a multidisciplinary and multicultural approach, they help illuminate the major challenges explored by the Foundation. Members present at this first meeting (alphabetical order): - CanTerra Jaime, Colombia - Yang Chen, China - Penda Diallo, Guinea - Anne Démians, France - Carlos Moreno, Franco-Colombian - Laura Petrella, Italy - Kalina Raskin, Franco-Bulgarian - Ngo-Duc Tranh, Vietnam - Philippe Vallette, France - Chris Younès, France Also present: Jacques Rougerie; Amine Lehna (Director of Development and International Relations of the Foundation); and Mohamed Emad (Director of the Junior Ambassadors Program). Structuring missions: - This inaugural session defined the Committee’s initial areas of work: - Supporting the strategic reflection of the Futures Laboratory, a new platform for research and experimentation. - Providing insight into the major themes championed by the Foundation in response to oceanic, climatic, and space-related challenges. - Enriching the themes of the international competition by stimulating architectural and scientific innovation. - Enhancing academic and artistic expertise by strengthening bridges between knowledge, creation, and youth. - Opening the Foundation to an international dynamic, including each year associate members and a college of young researchers under the age of 35. A clear ambition: illuminating futures at the intersection of knowledge and the living world The Foundation is launching an international and interdisciplinary initiative that brings together experts and researchers around a central conviction: the future of human societies is shaped at the crossroads of the arts, sciences, technologies, and the living world. This first meeting initiates a process of innovation and applied research aimed at imagining and testing new living frameworks—on land, in coastal and ocean environments, as well as in space—addressing ecological, technological, and societal transformations.  </p>
