    <p>  <br>On the occasion of the United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC), the Fondation Jacques Rougerie - Académie des beaux-arts had the privilege of hosting a high-level roundtable dedicated to adapting our coastlines in the face of climate disruption. <br> Bringing together experts in engineering, architecture, industry, and infrastructure, this event offered a space to explore innovative solutions at the heart of 21st-century progress-redefining how we inhabit, protect, and enhance our coastal areas. <br> We were honored to welcome: <br> 🔹 Robin Sigwald, Project Director - Coastal Resilience, Artelia  <br>🔹 Regis Boigegrain, Executive Director of Interconnections and Offshore Networks, RTE - Réseau de Transport d'Électricité  <br>🔹 Arnaud Ballay, Deputy CEO, ECOPLAGE  <br>🔹 Guy Sidos, Chairman and CEO, Vicat Group  <br>🔹 Isabelle MARANDET, Architect, Head of Specification, Saint-Gobain  <br>🔹 Stéphane Desvernay, Director of Investments - Founding Partner, Monterra Wealth Management <br>🔬🌱  These discussions are vital: they create unprecedented synergies across disciplines, foster the emergence of cross-sector projects, and shape a shared vision for a resilient and desirable future. <br> By offering a unique platform for exchange, the Fondation Jacques Rougerie reaffirms more than ever its role as a bridge between art, science, and technology in support of the ecological transition of our territories.</p>
