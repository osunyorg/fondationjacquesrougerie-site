    <p>  <br>International Architecture and Innovation Competition 2025 Featured on France Inter Jacques Rougerie was a guest of Lamarque Jose Manuel on France Inter to present the International Architecture and Innovation Competition of the Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Academy of Fine Arts. 👉 Listen to the podcast:  https://lnkd.in/djqzf8JT In this Year of the Sea and on the occasion of the United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC), coastal and maritime issues are at the heart of scientific debates around the world. It is only natural that architecture emerges as a major discipline in rethinking our current and future living environments. For a global challenge, a global response is needed. Through its network of Junior Ambassadors, the Foundation is present in over 100 countries to find local or global solutions by combining arts, sciences, and technologies in the service of Nature. For 15 years, the Foundation has annually awarded three major prizes to recognize visionary talents:  <br> 🏆 An Architecture and Innovation prize related to coastal issues and rising sea levels  <br> 🏆 An Architecture and Innovation prize for the sea  <br> 🏆 An Architecture and Innovation prize for space  <br> Architects, engineers, thinkers, artists, join this grand adventure to re-enchant our world! </p>  <p> 👉 I’m participating in the competition (until September 25):  https://lnkd.in/dS_C_uuD</p>
