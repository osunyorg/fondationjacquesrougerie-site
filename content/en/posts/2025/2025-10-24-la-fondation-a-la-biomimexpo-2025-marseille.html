    The Foundation at Biomim’EXPO 2025 – Marseille

    <p>  <br>The Foundation took part in Biomim’EXPO 2025, the leading event dedicated to biomimicry and innovation inspired by nature, held this year in Marseille under the initiative of Alain Renaudin. Jacques Rougerie spoke during the round table “Biodiversity, Climate, the Ocean, and Us… Intertwined Destinies”, alongside Gilles Boeuf (President of Ceebios), Patricia Ricard (President of the Paul Ricard Oceanographic Institute), and Maud Lelièvre (President of the French Committee of IUCN). He emphasized how the future of our societies is deeply connected to that of the living world, and how the architecture of tomorrow must draw inspiration from nature to address major climate and environmental challenges. At the same time, the Foundation, together with ROUGERIE+TANGRAM and SeaOrbiter, hosted a dedicated stand animated by Margot Chatel, one of the Foundation’s Junior Ambassadors. Among the many companies and institutions engaged in biomimicry, young people, families, and professionals discovered how nature inspires architecture and the innovations of the future. The Foundation’s participation in Biomim’EXPO 2025 reflects its mission to combine art, science, technology, and nature to design sustainable and desirable living environments in harmony with the planet’s ecosystems.</p>
