    COP30 in Belém: A Moment of Dialogue and Hope for the Future of Coastal and Island Territories
  summary: >-
    <p>The Foundation took part this week in COP30 in Belém, a decisive gathering for island nations, coastal territories, and the communities on the front line of rising sea levels.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Alongside young people from five continents, the Foundation led a session dedicated to climate mobility and the impacts of sea-level rise. The exchanges highlighted the commitment of a generation ready to imagine visionary solutions deeply rooted in their cultures and territories. The Foundation also participated in the round tables hosted at the Climate Mobility Pavilion, chaired by Carlos Alvarado Quesada, former President of Costa Rica. The discussions brought together:  <br> Maina Vakafua Talia, Minister of Climate of Tuvalu  <br> Rohey John Majang, Minister of Environment of Gambia  <br> Colincia Levine, Minister of Environment of Saint Kitts and Nevis  <br> Dr. Rajendra Prasad Mishra, international expert on climate resilience  <br> Several bilateral meetings further strengthened collaboration with:  <br> Mosese Bulitavu, Minister of Environment of Fiji  <br> Marie Nyange Ndambo, Minister of Environment of the DRC  <br> Amr Hamouda, President of the Egyptian Institute of Oceanography  <br> These exchanges carried the voice of nations that are among the most vulnerable yet among the richest in biodiversity — a voice of dignity, resilience, and determination. The Foundation’s delegation also had the opportunity to navigate the Amazon River, a powerful reminder of the vitality of this essential ecosystem and of the urgency to act with courage and solidarity. In Belém, one conviction became clear: sustainable and desirable futures can only emerge by combining arts, sciences, technologies, and nature; bio-inspired architectural innovation is essential to support communities facing sea-level rise. The Foundation will continue this commitment with determination, working closely with governments, researchers, artists, and youth worldwide to imagine and build resilient and harmonious living environments.</p>
