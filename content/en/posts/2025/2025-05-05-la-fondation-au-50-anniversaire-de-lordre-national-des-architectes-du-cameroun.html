    The Foundation at the 50th Anniversary of the National Order of Architects of Cameroon

    <p>  <br>On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the National Order of Architects of Cameroon (ONAC), the Foundation organized its first African Summit of Junior Ambassadors in Yaoundé, marking a key milestone in the program’s development across the continent. Bringing together young architects and creators from Cameroon, Gabon, Chad, Niger, and Senegal, the event offered a platform for dialogue on the major challenges of the 21st century: climate resilience, sustainable urban planning, environmental diplomacy, and South–South cooperation. Over several days, participants took part in workshops, round tables, and thematic discussions on transforming African cities in response to climate challenges. The summit concluded with the official induction ceremony of new Junior Ambassadors into the Foundation’s international network, which today brings together young talents from more than 100 countries. Two participants stood out in particular: Ydriss-Junior Ewoukem Nde and Doulan’ni Tizi Toumbarou, both from Cameroon — the latter being the 2024 laureate of the Foundation’s International Architecture and Innovation Competition. Their journeys embody the creative excellence and commitment of African youth to building a resilient and harmonious future. Among the speakers were Claire Parrin, professor at the Académie d’Architecture, Cedrix Tsambang, former Director of the Junior Ambassadors Program, and Jean-Christophe Ndongo, President of ONAC, alongside Amine Lehna, Head of International Strategy for the Foundation. Together, they praised the energy and creativity of this new generation of African architects. Shaping the Future Together: A Laboratory of Ideas for a Resilient World Under the theme “Sustainable Horizons in the Built Environment,” the African Summit of Junior Ambassadors served as a true space for reflection and co-creation. Young talents, experts, and institutional representatives explored themes of territorial innovation, intergenerational knowledge exchange, and regional cooperation. The final workshop, titled “Vision 2050,” opened collective perspectives on building sustainable and inclusive urban ecosystems. A shared conviction emerged: lasting solutions are born from dialogue between generations, disciplines, and territories—the very foundation of the spirit of the Foundation. 50 Years of Architecture in Central Africa: A Lasting Partnership with ONAC The Foundation also took part in the official celebrations of ONAC’s 50th anniversary, held at the Palais des Congrès in Yaoundé. Amine Lehna delivered a speech highlighting the central role of African youth in designing the resilient cities of tomorrow, before meeting with Madame Célestine Ketcha Courtès, Minister of Urban Development and Housing of Cameroon, to discuss opportunities for cooperation on sustainable urbanization. From France, Jacques Rougerie addressed the audience via videoconference, commending the momentum driven by Cameroonian architects and reaffirming the strong ties between the Foundation and ONAC. This partnership reflects a shared commitment to strengthening synergies between African and international actors in architecture and environmental innovation. Through their creativity and engagement, Central African architects are helping to reinvent the continent’s urban landscapes. The Foundation is proud to stand alongside them in this collective journey toward a sustainable and inspiring future.</p>
