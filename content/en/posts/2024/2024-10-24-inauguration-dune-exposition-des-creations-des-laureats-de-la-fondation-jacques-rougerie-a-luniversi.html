      <p>https://youtu.be/aHJU2nzP-C4</p>  <p>   <br>🌊  The Jacques Rougerie Foundation Celebrates 40 Years of Creation at the Ocean University of China in Qingdao  🌊 As part of the centennial celebration of the Ocean University of China, an international forum brought together representatives from 60 countries to discuss a crucial theme:  "The Ocean, Future of Humanity."  As the guest of honor, Jacques Rougerie addressed major climate and environmental issues facing the oceans, sharing his research and vision through the SeaOrbiter project and the creations of the ROUGERIE+TANGRAM agency. Two highlights marked this event: 🖼️ The inauguration of an exhibition dedicated to Jacques Rougerie’s 40 years of creation and to the work of the Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Académie des Beaux-Arts. This exhibition showcases the realistic and visionary creations of thousands of candidates for the Foundation's awards. Installed for three months in the university library, the exhibit celebrates the dedication and daring spirit of those working for the future of the oceans and space. This exhibition offers students an opportunity to discover the Institut de France, the Académie des beaux-arts, and the universe of Jacques Rougerie. It also serves as a prelude to the Foundation’s participation in the United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice in June 2025. 🎓 The awarding of the prestigious title of Professor Honoris Causa to Jacques Rougerie by the Ocean University of China in Qingdao, in recognition of his exceptional commitment to ocean preservation. Jacques Rougerie also gave a major lecture to university students, promoting a creative mindset dedicated to innovative and sustainable solutions. A heartfelt thank you to the Ocean University of China for this recognition and its warm welcome, which strengthens our commitment to a future in harmony with the ocean. 🌊</p>
