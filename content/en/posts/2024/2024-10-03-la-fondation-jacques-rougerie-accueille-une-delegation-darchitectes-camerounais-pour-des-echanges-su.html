        <p>The Jacques Rougerie Foundation welcomed a delegation of Cameroonian architects. We were honored to receive a distinguished delegation of architects from Cameroon, including Mr. Jean Christophe Ndongo, President of the Cameroon Order of Architects, and Cédrix Tsambang, Director of the Junior Ambassadors Program.  Jacques ROUGERIE had the pleasure of presenting the values and vision of our Foundation, particularly regarding innovation in architecture and sustainability in response to rising sea levels and climate change. Together, we engaged in insightful discussions about the future of African coastal territories and the importance of architectural solutions tailored to these unique environments.  This meeting also laid the foundation for a promising partnership between the Jacques Rougerie Foundation and Cameroonian architects, aimed at fostering sustainable and innovative design across Africa. We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to collaborating on impactful projects in the near future!</p>
