    “Architecture et Innovation related to Climate and Rising Water” Grand Prix Award Regenerative Islands Yuki MoriPacific atoll islands are threatened by coastal erosion and flooding from storms and rising sea levels must adapt to the changing natural environment. This proposal does not destroy ecosystems through artificial barriers, but rather promotes the islands' capacity for sustainable self-growth by controlling ocean waves and promoting the accumulation of sand on the islands. Additionally, by creating reefs on the shallows, the environment, culture and ecosystem of the island nation will be rebuilt, creating a future with new landscapes gently adapted to climate change.“Architecture and Innovation for the Sea” Grand Prix Award & The Special “Lab Architecture and Innovation” Award Solar Cell Handré de la reySolar Cell revolves around the search for harmony between natural elements while considering an aesthetic favoring the integration of eco-design. Solar Cell explores the two key connectors of diverse marine environments and the potential for energy-saving properties they possess: salt and sunlight. The cell lends itself to a variety of locations and the needs required by its users. This fine and aesthetic structure is a living space, providing fresh water, electricity and crops.“Architecture and Innovation for the Space” Grand Prix Award ASCENSIO Jordan William HughesThe project explores the exciting prospect of combining a sustainable ocean-based space elevator with a multipurpose spaceport. Dedicated to the orbital spectacle, this project aims to make exploration and space tourism more accessible without major environmental impact.The scope of the project extends from oceans to capturing an asteroid.“Architecture and Innovation for the Space” Coup de coeur nternational Sustainable Space Union Matija TomšićSustainable space development represents a significant obstacle that humanity must overcome to ensure a prosperous and sustainable space future.We must never forget that our ability to launch rockets from Earth is the cornerstone of humanity's space future. With plans to establish bases on the Moon, Mars and beyond, it becomes essential that we take steps to prevent Kessler syndrome. The goal is to remove debris from orbit and implement the use of reusable rockets to minimize environmental impact. We can create an orbital industry for clean energy and make space more accessible while preserving our heritage“Architecture and Innovation for the Space” Special Mention Terraforming Ray Shotaro HasegawaMars is an inhospitable environment due to its strong winds and barren soil. The planet is devoid of surface water and experiences hurricanes called “Dust Devil” which reshape its surface. The “terraforming ray” is an architecture that harnesses the energy of Martian winds and purifies toxic soil, transforming it into fertile soil. Mars would then become a habitable and welcoming planet. Its name comes from the hydrodynamic shape of its rays. By expanding in a coordinated manner, it creates a new landscape with revitalized water and plants.
