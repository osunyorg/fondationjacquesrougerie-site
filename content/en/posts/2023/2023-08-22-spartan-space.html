As one of France's New Space start-ups, Spartan Space was invited to present its EUROHAB lunar module, alongside the French National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) and Ariane Group.It was an ideal opportunity to discuss France's role in space and the need to promote a strong French contribution to future lunar missions.A project supported by the Jacques Rougerie Foundation After walking on the moon, it may soon be possible for scientists and astronauts to stay there thanks to the EUROHAB lunar hut designed by Peter Weiss and the start-up Spartan Space. Awarded the Jacques Rougerie Foundation’s Architecture Prize in 2020, this accompany project to future lunar exploration missions was able to build its prototype inflatable and mobile structure with the ESA-European Space Agency and Air Liquide thanks to the Foundation’s network.
