    <p>For over 30 years, Jacques Rougerie has based his work on biomimetic, bio-inspired, resilient and sustainable architecture. In this spirit, he has built underwater habitats and laboratories, sea centers, transparent-hulled vessels, underwater museums, floating village projects, and a lunar base and village.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>A visionary architect born in 1945, Jacques Rougerie lived in Côte d'Ivoire until the age of 11. He attended the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1964 in the former Auguste Perret studio run by André Remondet and Paul Maymont.  Fascinated by Cousteau's adventure and the first underwater houses, he began a course of study at the Institut Océanographique of Paris in 1970, at the same time as enrolling at the Université d'Urbanisme de Vincennes and the Ecole des Arts et Métiers under the direction of Jean Prouvé.  Combining his two passions, he travelled the world following in the footsteps of the peoples of the sea, studying their ethno-sociological traditions and visiting the countries with the most advanced offshore technologies.  He became a qualified architect in 1972, and from the outset devoted himself to the development of specifically marine projects. He set up the Centre d'architecture de la mer et de l'espace in 1974 before founding Jacques Rougerie Architectes associés. Jacques Rougerie devotes a great deal of time to his teaching activities in France and abroad.</p>  <p>   <br>"Whatever one man can imagine, other men are capable of realizing". <br>Jules Verne</p>  <p> Distinctions  <br> Podcasts & talks </p>
