        <p>Architect Jacques Rougerie was received by Academician Roger Taillibert under the dome of the Institut de France on June 3, 2009, for his installation at the Académie des Beaux-Arts. Jacques Rougerie's dual heritage and equal passion for the sea and architecture combine in his work the imaginary and the real, foresight and construction, without ever forgetting mankind and, above all, their dreams. Canal Académie invites you to listen to the full broadcast of this ceremony.</p><p>In this program, you'll hear Roger Taillibert and Jacques Rougerie give their speeches: one to welcome his new colleague, the other in tribute to his late predecessor, André Wogenscky (1916-2004).</p><p>Following his installation, Jacques Rougerie was presented with his academician's sword.</p>
