    <p>Actualités du Conseil scientifique </p>  <p> The word of the Scientific council' chair  <br>Pr. Carlos Moreno <br>Chair of the Foundation’s Scientific Council, Urban Planner, and Scientific Director of the ETI Chair, IAE Paris-Sorbonne</p>  <p> Présentation du Conseil scientifique  <br>For centuries, the planet—through nature and humankind—has shaped masterpieces within which we live and evolve. From source to ocean, from inland territories to coastlines and onward into space, we move through worlds of balance, form, and structure that continuously nourish our imagination. In a context marked by profound and global ecological, social, and cultural transformations, the Jacques Rougerie Foundation – Académie des beaux-arts, under the honorary presidency of H.S.H. Prince Albert II of Monaco, places architecture at the heart of a fertile dialogue between the arts, sciences, and technologies, in the service of nature and its biodiversity. Convinced that responses to the challenges posed by rising freshwater and saltwater levels linked to climate change—as well as to major terrestrial and oceanic issues—will emerge from multidisciplinarity, intercultural openness, and the boldness of younger generations, the Foundation relies on a committed global community active across all five continents. As part of its 2030–2050 strategy, the Foundation has decided to establish an international scientific committee. Conceived as a consultative and forward-looking body, this committee’s mission is to support the Foundation’s major strategic directions, ensure the quality of its outputs, enrich the strategic reflection of its Futures Laboratory, and foster cross-disciplinary, cross-territorial, and intergenerational exchanges. It is a space for monitoring, expression, and influence: a place of encounter for high-level multicultural figures brought together by a shared ambition—to build and re-enchant present and future living environments.</p>  <p> Members of the scientific Council </p>  <p>The permanent members of the Scientific Committee number ten, selected for their excellence in complementary fields: architecture, climate science, oceanography, engineering, the humanities, and public policy. Comprising five women and five men, they embody a deliberate balance across disciplines, generations, and cultures. Their commitment is rooted in a dynamic of exchange, knowledge transfer, and innovation. Each member contributes to strengthening the Foundation’s strategic reflection and to amplifying its voice on the international stage.</p>  <p>Chair of the scientific Council</p>  <p>Climatologist – Vietnam</p>  <p>Marine Biologist – Colombia</p>  <p>Architect - France</p>  <p>Architect - France</p>  <p>Philosopher of Architecture - France</p>  <p>Architect and Urban Planning Expert – Italy</p>  <p>Urbanist - China</p>  <p>Oceanographer - France</p>  <p>Biomimicry Expert – Bulgaria</p>
