        <p>The Planet and all the remarkable things it creates are masterpieces in which we live. We cross territories, oceans, skies and stratospheres, each time discovering the richness of their bodies, their structure and the diversity of their forms, from the infinitely small to the infinitely large.</p><p>We have become aware of the treasures that populate and cover it, of their power and elegance. In these complex and uncertain times, major changes are affecting and overturning our planet. The climate, societies and the rights of living beings are all changing. We need to be imaginative. But above all, we must learn to observe in order to act. And to anticipate better.</p><p>Creators, thinkers, artists, talented, women and men: the Planet is waiting for you!</p><p>For those of you who are inspired and passionate, some with the energy of your youth, others armed with your convictions, and who wish to commit yourselves to a resilient future, you can design and build it so that it lasts and withstands the shocks of a modernity that has been reordered and transformed.</p><p>In 2023, for its 13th edition, the Foundation invites you to push back the boundaries. Don't be afraid to dream by daring, now more than ever. You can have an influence and propose reinvented living environments, through architecture, a permanent field of creation and experimentation at the confluence of the arts, sciences and technologies. Nature is a constant source of inspiration: biomimicry, with its 3.8 billion years of evolutionary history, allows us to open up and explore this unprecedented path of innovation. The great Leonardo da Vinci once said: <i>"Take your lessons from nature, that's where our future lies".</i></p><p>Your projects should be bold and forward-looking. Enthusiastic rather than standardised, they will demonstrate that inspiration, when it combines form, function and environment, can take a simple idea to places where it is least expected. Based primarily on biomimicry, in line with the need to protect our ecosystems and their biodiversity, they should be conceived and designed in a multi-disciplinary way.<br></p><p>There will be 10 billion of us by 2050. Three quarters of the population will live near rivers and sea shores and will be directly affected by climate change, rising sea levels and erosion. As for space exploration, it is now inevitable and must be part of a transgenerational approach, conducive to other possibilities, and change paradigms to reconcile Humanity and Nature.</p>
