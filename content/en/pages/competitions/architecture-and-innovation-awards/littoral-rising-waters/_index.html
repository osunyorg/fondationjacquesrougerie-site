    <p>Let's work towards greater environmental responsibility by integrating the challenges of littorals change and rising sea levels into the development of our society.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>By 2050, the world's population will reach 10 billion <br>people, three quarters of whom will live near rivers and sea coasts, directly <br>exposed to the threats of climate change and rising sea levels.Faced with this reality, it is imperative to rethink <br>our approaches to urban planning, development, and coastal management to ensure <br>the safety and sustainability of coastal communities.Today, we are facing an unprecedented acceleration in rising sea levels, <br>which is a major challenge for our century. Water is rising by an average of <br>3.2m year. UN experts predict that the current level will rise by almost one <br>meter by 2100. The effects of this accelerated rise are already visible in many <br>countries and regions of the world. Catastrophic climatic events such as <br>flooding are already the consequence of this phenomenon. We must not give in to catastrophism but seize the <br>opportunities for innovation and transformation that lie ahead in the coming <br>decades, to adapt our living environments, cities and territories.The challenges of coastal preservation and development are <br>numerous: rising sea levels, flooding, pollution, erosion... We must preserve <br>our heritage and invent new models for sustainable and resilient coastal <br>habitats and cities, in harmony with the environment.The challenge is to design scalable solutions adapted to local conditions, <br>taking into account the environmental, social, cultural and economic dynamics <br>of coastal zones. This implies a holistic approach integrating urban planning, <br>landscaping and coastal engineering to strengthen infrastructure resilience <br>while preserving nature.Your project must address the challenges of coastal <br>preservation and development, taking into account the population at risk, its <br>demographic profile and its vulnerability. It must propose innovative and locally adapted <br>solutions, integrating urban, architectural and landscape dynamics, <br>strengthening the resilience of infrastructures while respecting the <br>environment (soil condition, biodiversity, coastline) and promoting biodiversity. <br>The project must aim to optimize energy resources to ensure sustainable <br>economic growth, while preserving harmony with nature and local realities. This theme is aimed at any passionate <br>multi-disciplinary individual or team, to imagine architectural systems, <br>techniques, innovations, concepts, scientific models and engineering methods <br>using modern and ancestral knowledge and technologies. The aim is to respect <br>civilization, local identity, cultural, social and environmental values, in <br>harmony with the way of life of local communities and populations, while <br>reflecting our globalized world.</p>  <p> SOME PROJECTS TO DISCOVER IN OUR DATABASE... </p>  <p>   <br>Find all the nominated and winning projects on the Foundation's database</p>
