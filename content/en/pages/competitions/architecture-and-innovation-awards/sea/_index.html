    <p>  <br>Architectural innovation linked to bio-inspiration and sustainable development are the watchwords of this call for creativity. Humanity is at a crucial crossroads in its history, <br>facing unprecedented environmental challenges. Among these ones, the <br>preservation and proper management of marine resources is of paramount <br>importance.   The ocean is our planet's most important resource, <br>thanks to its multiple capacities in energy, pharmacology, food and so many <br>other fields. Yet the seas and oceans are still poorly understood and poorly <br>managed to ensure symbiosis with the needs of the whole of humanity.    It is essential to place people and their environment <br>at the center of all thinking, particularly when designing ocean-related <br>projects. This requires specifically adapted engineering, that takes into <br>account the unique characteristics of the marine or submarine environment, such <br>as marine dynamics, depth, buoyancy, pressure and living conditions, whether <br>saturated or at atmospheric pressure.   The main objective is to design and implement <br>sustainable, self-sufficient marine or underwater structures capable of meeting <br>essential human needs while preserving the integrity of marine ecosystems and <br>their delicate balance. Your project must take into account the particular <br>lifestyle of the people living in this extreme environment. It must also aim <br>for energy self-sufficiency and autonomy, using natural sources such as tidal <br>turbines, wave collectors or ocean thermal energy...  In this quest for <br>sustainability, the project must promote biodiversity and minimize its <br>footprint on ecosystems, by implementing strategies for waste management and <br>preserving marine biodiversity. Mobility must also be taken into account: what <br>means of transport will be used in relation to the land? Your project must be designed <br>as a circular economy model, favoring maximum recyclability of the materials <br>used, in order to have a positive ecological impact.   </p>  <p> Your project must represent a crucial step towards a <br>future where man and ocean coexist harmoniously. By adopting a rigorous <br>scientific approach and a bold vision, we can harness the ocean's riches while <br>preserving its splendor for future generations. </p>  <p> SOME PROJECTS TO DISCOVER IN OUR DATABASE... </p>  <p>   <br>Find all the nominated and winning projects on the  Foundation's database</p>
