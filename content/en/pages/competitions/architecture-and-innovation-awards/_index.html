Architecture allows us to conceptualise and prepare the necessary adaptation to climate change. Taking part in this competition gave us the opportunity to share our vision of tomorrow's world. The competition has been a real springboard in our careers. Firstly through the recognition of our work, but above all thanks to the people we were able to meet, all united around architecture to reflect on the issues of tomorrow. It reinforced my desire to work on projects to adapt our territories to climate change." <br>Coralie Brival <br>Winner of the Focus 2019 "Littoral Africain" prize in the Ocean Rise category, member of the 2020 jury | France</p>  <p>"My dream was to be part of the first generation of architects to design in space. This competition was a way of realising that dream: the motivation and inspiration it gave me inspired me to apply for other international competitions. It gave me a lot of hope for future construction in space. The Foundation is like an 'academy' now! I've been preparing for it every year for the last six years. I now teach young students about architecture in space." <br>Samer El Sayary <br>Winner of the Focus prize "The Lunar Village" 2020 in the Space category | Egypt</p>  <p> The GRAND PRIX </p>  <p> MANIFESTO  <br>The Earth and all its wonders are <br>masterpieces in which we evolve. We cross territories, littorals, oceans, <br>skies, stratospheres, and each time, we discover, the richness of their bodies, <br>their structure, and the diversity of their forms, from the infinitely small to <br>the infinitely large. We've opened our eyes to the treasures <br>that fill our planet, their strength and elegance. In this era of tumultuous <br>change, where climate, societies and the rights of living beings are constantly <br>evolving, it's time to act with imagination. Let's observe, anticipate, act and <br>reenchant our world! Thinkers, artists, architects, engineers, <br>you are the artisans of tomorrow!  Thanks to your boundless energy and <br>burning passion, you are ready to shape a resilient future. In this 15th edition of the Prix de la <br>Fondation, let’s push back the frontiers of audacity. Dare to dream, because <br>today more than ever, your ideas can shape a better world. Take your inspiration from nature, that <br>inexhaustible source of innovation. Biomimicry, fruit of 3.8 billion years of <br>evolution, opens up unsuspected horizons to imagine current and future living <br>environments. As Leonardo da Vinci said, "Take your lessons from nature: <br>that's where our future lies". Your projects need to be bold, current or forward-looking <br>and enthusiastic! Based on biomimicry, they must be rooted in the preservation <br>of our ecosystems and their biodiversity. Designed in a multidisciplinary and multicultural <br>way, they demonstrate that inspiration, when combined with form, function and <br>environment, can reach unsuspected heights. Let’s provide answers to the challenges of <br>our century through the development of artistic, architectural, technological <br>and bio-inspired, in line with the major climatic and environmental issues <br>relating in particular to coastlines and rising sea levels, as well as projects <br>linked to the submarine, marine and spatial worlds. Open up new horizons, encouraging us to <br>change paradigms and reconcile Humanity and Nature. </p>  <p> Let's embark together towards a radiant <br>future, where innovation and sustainability are our guiding principles.</p>
