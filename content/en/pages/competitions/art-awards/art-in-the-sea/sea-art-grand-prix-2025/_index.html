  summary: >-
    <p>Yann Bagot, a French draftsman and engraver, develops an immersive drawing practice through direct contact with natural elements. Through residencies in wilderness environments, he experiments with ink, water, and salt outdoors, allowing natural forces to intervene in the gesture and radically transform the lines.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>A drawing practice to experience the landscape through an immersive encounter with the elements Yann Bagot develops a drawing practice rooted in in situ experiences in direct contact with nature. During immersive residencies along the coast, in forests, and in the mountains, he seeks to become one with the place and to live the intensity of the moment. Tested by the terrain, his drawings explore the reactions between India ink, water, and salt on paper. Drawing as close as possible to the rising tide, at nightfall, in the rain; immersing the drawings in the sea or beneath a waterfall: the constraints of working outdoors trigger radical choices, natural movements burst into the works, and the lines are profoundly disrupted. A multiple-time finalist for the David-Weill Prize of the Académie des Beaux-Arts (2012, 2021, 2022), Yann Bagot presents his work in exhibitions in France, Europe, and Asia. He also devotes himself to printmaking and the creation of artists’ books, and regularly collaborates with musicians and contemporary writers. Alongside his personal work, he draws as part of the artists’ collective Ensaders, with which he takes part in performances and exhibitions and leads drawing workshops. <br>More about  his art</p>  <p> Yann Bagot, dessinateur  <br>EXHIBITIONS  <br>2025 <br>  <br>  <br>Drawing Now, Galerie Berthet-Aittouarès, Carreau du Temple, Paris <br>  <br>  <br> La nature en question , Galerie Berthet-Aittouarès, Paris, France <br>  <br>  <br> La nature en question II , Galerie Berthet-Aittouarès, Paris, France <br>  <br>  <br>2024 <br>  <br>  <br>Finalist of the competition  "Integration of an artwork in the Tunnel of the Paris CDG Airport - Express project" , presented by Guy Boyer and Art en direct <br>  <br>  <br>Group exhibitions: <br>  <br>  <br>Le 104, Paris <br>  <br>  <br>Belgian Gallery, Brussels <br>  <br>  <br>Villa Roche Brunes, Dinard <br>  <br>  <br>Galerie Octave Cowbell, Metz <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>2023 <br>  <br>  <br>Mention, David Weill Drawing Prize - Académie des Beaux-Arts <br>  <br>  <br>Group exhibition: <br>  <br>  <br>Galerie Antoine Dupin, Cancale <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>2022 <br>  <br>  <br>Finalist,  Écouter Voir  Prize - Carré sur Seine <br>  <br>  <br>Finalist, David Weill Drawing Prize - Académie des Beaux-Arts <br>  <br>  <br>Group exhibitions: <br>  <br>  <br>Galerie du Jour Agnès b. - La Fab., Paris <br>  <br>  <br>La Fabrique - Centre d'Art, Montreuil <br>  <br>  <br>Espace Commines - Association Florence, Paris <br>  <br>  <br>Galerie Olivier Waltman, Paris <br>  <br>  <br>Fondation Fernet-Branca, Saint-Louis <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Collections:  <br>  <br>  <br>Agnès b.
