summary: >-
  <p>Armed with his intuition and guided by his socially responsible approach to art, the artist Jérémy Gobé has come up with Corail Artefact: a global solution to combat the disappearance of coral reefs. To achieve this, he has drawn on his status as an individual artist to set up an entrepreneurial project to develop the project's research (artistic, scientific and industrial) and awareness-raising activities (for schools and the general public).</p>

        <p>Armed with his intuition and guided by his socially responsible approach to art, the artist Jérémy Gobé has come up with Corail Artefact: a global solution to combat the disappearance of coral reefs.</p><p> To achieve this, he has drawn on his status as an individual artist to set up an entrepreneurial project to develop the project's research (artistic, scientific and industrial) and awareness-raising activities (for schools and the general public).</p><p><br><b>An art-science-industry-education project to save the coral reefs</b></p><p><i>"Human work, and the gestures it instigates, are the common thread running through all Jérémy Gobé's creations. The artist often extends natural elements - sea urchins, butterflies, coral - through manual means - knitting, drawing, sculpture - to create hybrid objects full of poetry. His projects begin with many chance encounters, his works taking shape from what he finds along the way, abandoned fabrics or found objects to which he (re)gives a certain nobility.</i></p><p><i>Corail, restauration is a long-term, multi-faceted project in which Jérémy Gobé works with coral. For Meltem, the artist imagines a piece of red coral which, aided by construction pegs of the same colour, becomes an organism invading the space of the Galerie Haute. This proliferation of natural and manufactured substances appears as a threat in the exhibition, an invasion of the living, starting from a wooden table and ending its journey on grey marble slabs".</i></p><p>Catherine Strasser and Daria de Beauvais<br>Curators of the Meltem exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo, March 2013</p>

        <p>"It started out as an aesthetic approach, then I realized that these shapes had a function. In creating life, nature makes extraordinary forms! This resonated with me, in the idea of a systemic approach." Jérémy Gobé is the guest of architect Jacques Rougerie and sculptor Jean-Michel Othoniel, both members of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. He answers their questions about his work on corals.</p>

        <p>His work reflects a vision of art "in life". He seeks out workers without works and materials without workers, objects without use and works without shape. In the course of his exhibitions in France and abroad, his works propose a reconnection with nature. Following Auguste Rodin's motto: "art that has life does not reproduce the past, it continues it", Jérémy Gobé, inspired by ancient know-how, imagines global solutions to contemporary problems. Since 2017, he has been creating Corail Artefact, an art science industry project to save the coral reefs.</p>
